# CA-COVID
While ODE-IVP Models have dominated Epidemiological Modeling for their superior performance and flexibility, they fail to capture the microscopic (relatively speaking) interactions between populations that account for the spread of disease. Acknowledging the nature of infectious disease and to be specific COVID, using a Cellular Automaton can be extremely useful to model the spread given certain initial conditions. Loosely using the model described in [A Data-driven Understanding of COVID-19 Dynamics Using Sequential Genetic Algorithm Based Probabilistic Cellular Automata â€“ Sayantari Ghosha, Saumik Bhattacharya] this project contains two parts:  
1) Model with Genetic Algorithm 
2) Model with Visualizations and Data Production
